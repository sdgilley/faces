The AUC is a number between 0 and 1.  It corresponds to the area under the ROC curve. It is a performance metric related to how good the model is at separating the two classes (converted clients vs. not converted), with a good choice of decision threshold separating between the predicted probabilities.Â  The closer the AUC is to 1, and the better the model is. Given that we are not looking for that optimal decision threshold, the AUC is more representative of the prediction performance than the Accuracy (which depends on the threshold).
